# bike_visualizations-
Automating visualizations in Python 

Functions that return scatterplots, histograms, and barplots of a rider's metrics (i.e. heartrate, cadence, power) over the course of a bike ride. Some of the visualizations determine how often the cyclist is riding faster than his average velocity independent of the slope.
